## Problem 6: Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

`1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385`

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

`(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025.`

Hence, the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and
the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares
of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Notes

I took the obvious brute force solution again. In this case it takes trivial time anyway.
There is a formula[^1] you can use to calculate the result directly, but I never would
have come up with it on my own.
