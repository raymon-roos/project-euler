## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By
starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

`1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...`
`  2     8       34`

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four
million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Notes

Starting the sequence with `1, 2` is a little surprising to me, I'm used to it starting
with `0, 1`. I'd also like there to be an example result, so that I can be absolutely sure
I understood the problem correctly.

My own solution is the naive one, which has to calculate all the Fibonacci numbers up to
the limit and discard the odd ones. This involves a lot of "wasted" computation. There's
some proper math you can do to compute the even numbers directly, but I couldn't follow
any of it.
