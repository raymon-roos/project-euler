# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) solutions in Rust

The Euler project is a large collection of mathy programming problems. This repo contains
(some) solutions I made. All credit for the problems goes to the creator of
projecteuler.net.

The problems are organized into subdirectories, and I provide the description in
a markdown file for easy reference. Any commentary under a `# Notes` section in one of
these `exercise.md` files is my own, and not that of the original creator of
projecteuler.net.
