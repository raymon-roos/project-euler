Find the thirteen consecutive digits in this 1000-digit number that have the greatest
product. What is the value of this product?

## Notes

Cool, a sliding window problem! I learnt about this at some point, but have never used it
before. Rust even has a built-in method for this. In the truest window implementation, in
each "step" of the window, one should "add" the new entry and "remove" the dropped one
from some internal value without recalculating the internal value. The question is about
a product though, and not a sum. We could multiply the old window product with the new
number, and divide it by the one dropped from the window. Only, the 1000-digit number
contains some zeros, which need to be guarded against when dividing.

I ended up just re-calculating the product for each window for the first version. I'd also
like to be able to point to the index of the start of the largest-product-sub-sequence.
